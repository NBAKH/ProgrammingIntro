# Programming intro

This is a teaching resource to be used for facilitating a five part introduction to programming workshop series. The students will go from not having programmed before to creating their own functional game of pong with the processing language. The series can be expanded to include a small introduction to arduino and physical computing by using sensors as the controls. 

## Overview

### Lesson_1: The field

You will learn to draw the playing field, the two paddles, the ball and write the score. All of these elements will be static and you will learn how to aggregate similar operations into functions. You will also learn how to properly use variables in your code.

### Lesson_2: The ball

In this lesson you will learn how to make the ball move. Besides simply moving the ball this also entails using its position to calculate collisions with the top and bottom edges of the field, making the ball bounce off these. In a similar way you will use the position of the ball to register 'goals' scored and update the relevant score. 

### Lesson_3: The paddles

In this lesson you will respond to user-input on the keyboard making the two paddles move. You will also program the ball to collide with the two paddles and bounce in the opposite direction. 

### Lesson_4: The states 

In this lesson you will incorporate states into your game. By using states you will be able to add a welcome screen, aggregate the previously programmed functionallity into a game state, and add a result screen. 

### Lesson_5: The flash

Various improvements you can make to your game.
